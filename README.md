# Distributed Software for Spark Radio

A distributed systems project implemented in Java using **Apache Spark** to support the backend logic for a **Spark Radio** application. This project demonstrates core distributed computing concepts such as parallel data processing, fault tolerance, and cluster-oriented execution.

## 📌 Project Overview

**Distributed Software for Spark Radio** is a Java-based distributed system that runs on an Apache Spark cluster to handle workloads typical of a distributed radio application. The software processes, distributes, and aggregates data/tasks across worker nodes efficiently using Spark’s distributed computing model. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

*(Insert a short one-sentence description here of what “Spark Radio” means in your project context — e.g., real-time streaming, simulation, messaging, workload distribution, event processing.)*

## 🧠 Key Features

- Distributed processing using Apache Spark
- Scalable architecture for handling large data or parallel tasks
- Implements core distributed system principles (e.g., task scheduling, data partitioning)
- Modular Java source code under `src/`
